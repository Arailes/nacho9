This is a JS script for calculating the outcome of triangular arbitrage opportunities on Uniswap DEX. It can be modified to spot opportunities on other DEXs too.

This program will only calculate and show the trade outcome opportunities, use it at your own risk.

In order to use the program you need to have the list of triangular arbitrage opportunities generated by my python script (you can find it on my repositories).
